# WaterRowerData for iOS

A swift package for reading data from a BLE-connected WaterRower device.

## WaterRowerData-BLE

The WaterRowerData-BLE target contains the sources for reading data from
a BLE connected WaterRower device, such as an S5 monitor.
See [WaterRowerData-BLE/Readme](Sources/WaterRowerData-BLE/README.md) for 
usage instructions.

## Setup

// TODO

## Development

Swift Package Manager is used to test and build this library:

 - `swift build` builds the sources into binaries
 - `swift test` buils and runs the tests

Open `WaterRowerData-iOS.xcodeproj` to start editing the source files.  
Open `iOS Example/iOS Example.xcworkspace` to view and run the sample
application.
